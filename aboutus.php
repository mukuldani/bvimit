										<strong> Dr. Patangrao Kadam </strong>

										<br> Chancellor, Bharati Vidyapeeth Deemed University
									</p>

									<p>
										I am indeed happy to welcome you to Bharati Vidyapeeth’s Institute of Management &amp; Information Technology, Navi Mumbai, which has a large pool of new executive talent waiting to step into the Corporate World.
									</p>
									<p>
										I established Bharati Vidyapeeth in 1964 with a realization that all-round social transformation can be brought about through the spread of education. During the last 50 years, we have established more than 180 educational units of various kinds, right from Pre-Primary School to a full-fledged University, in different parts of India and even in the capital city of New Delhi. Bharati Vidyapeeth is an institution with its distinct ideology, which can be briefly stated thus. Our objective is: “To make quality education accessible to the students coming from different regions and different strata of the Society and to provide the same to them as per their individual choices and inclination at affordable prices”. Our constant endeavor is to create ambience in the campuses propitious for learning by providing continuously updated courses and with the help of enriched infrastructural facilities such as well equipped laboratories, rich library and well maintained playground, hostels. It is a gratifying experience for me to know that thousands of students who have passed out from the portals of our institutions have established themselves very well in different walks of life.
									</p>
									<p>
										In April 1996, the Government of India conferred the status of University to a cluster of our institutions in accordance with the provision in the University Grants Commission Act, 1956. Since the inception of this University, our endeavor has been to develop it as a lively and throbbing centre of learning and research. I am very happy to say that, within the short span of 18 years, this University has established its academic reputation not only across the country but also overseas. This is evident from the fact that we get students from different parts of India and also from number of countries across the globe. I have no doubt that we will be able to achieve theses objectives in co-operation with our faculties of various institutions which include experts, experienced and caring teachers.
									</p>
									<p>
										I wish, your association with BVIMIT, Navi Mumbai, would be mutually beneficial one, which can be le veraged to yield promising results for both of us. The institute has a flagship Post-graduate programme, viz., Master of Computer Applications (MCA) affiliated to Mumbai University, approved by AICTE.
									</p>
									<p>
										We are confident you will find here, the perfect profile to complem ent your requirements.
